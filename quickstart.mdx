## Utilizing Octobot AI (In Development)

1. In the right sidebar of the app you will find Octobot, the Doctopus AI that uniquely understands your project and the documentation for any packages you’re using.

2. You can open and close the Octobot by selecting the 🐙 emoji in the top right of the window. When Octobot is active a ✨ will appear over the octopus.

3. You can use Octobot AI to ask questions, generate code examples, and much more.

> Note: Octobot is in early development and some features are unavailable in the current release.
